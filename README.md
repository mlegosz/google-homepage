Intro:
This project is to build the google homepage from scratch. The goal is to learn basic HTML and CSS, not worrying about functionality of the website for now. 

Hoping to learn:
- basics of html: structure, linking to css and images, content, etc.
- basics of css: styling, formatting, etc.
- how to use chrome dev tools
- how to use VScode IDE with live server
- how to use git for version control
- how to push to github

Reflection after completing:
- what looked like a seamingly simple page was much more complicated then expected
- chrome developer tools were great, but google's html + CSS was very complex and difficult to make sense of so I had to rely on google to find out how to do certain things
- lots of opportunities to clean up my code... I was retyping a lot of css that I could have combined - two search buttons with separate classes at first I simply combined after realizing they had the same style search1, search2 {}
- CSS is loooooong... I see the importance of categorizing sections and perhaps having a legend at the top. I ordered my CSS based on the order of elements in my HTML
- I can see myself getting better with practice.. each day I opened up VScode I seemed to work a bit faster than the day before
